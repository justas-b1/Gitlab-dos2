# Unauthenticated Gitlab DoS - POC Code

Uncontrolled Resource Consumption - 8vCPU &amp; 16GB RAM GCP Instance OOM Crash.

Gitlab doesn't accept 99.9% of DoS vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is out-of-scope unfortunately üòî.

`DoS vulnerabilities caused by unlimited input fields`

Out-of-scope bugs are useless noise (üóëÔ∏è) ‚Äî they waste time chasing irrelevant issues that don‚Äôt impact the actual target, like reporting a typo in a login page‚Äôs footer. They distract from real threats, clog reports with garbage, and show you didn‚Äôt bother reading the rules.

Submitting them is like demanding a refund for a sandwich you didn‚Äôt order.

## Video POC

## üîç Explanation

The GitLab /api/graphql endpoint doesn't enforce strict input size limits, allowing it to accept very large payloads. While this flexibility is useful, it can lead to issues when the payload grows significantly in size.

Internally, the GraphQL API performs several resource-intensive operations, such as querying for large datasets or resolving complex queries. These operations are generally manageable if the input payload is small, typically under 1KB. However, when the input grows to several megabytes, it places considerable strain on the backend. This can result in slower response times, higher memory usage, and in extreme cases, timeouts or failures.

The namespace in variables can by anything, I.E

variables = {
    "fullPath": "1xxxxxxxx1xx123/xxxxxxx1xxxxxxx123",
}

You don't need to find any actual namespaces in that instance.

## Impact

Auto-scaling under attack can cause a cost spike, potentially breaching budget thresholds or credit limits.

If there's no auto-scaling and instance is default, recommended 8vCPU and 16GB ram:

In Linux, an OOM (Out-of-Memory) crash is technically referred to as an "OOM Killer event" or "OOM-induced system termination." In POC video, it crashes at ~2:00.

**Attack Vector (AV:N)** - Attacker can exploit this remotely.

**Attack Complexity (AC:L)** - Attack uses a very simple python script.

**Privileges Required (PR:N)** - The endpoint is unauthenticated.

**User Interaction (UI:N)** - There's no user interaction required.

**Scope (S:C)** - Changed. Affects VM, which is above Gitlab application and also affects cloud hosting account if auto-scaling is enabled.

**Integrity Impact (I:N)** - None. Might be low if temporary data is lost during VM crash.

![Integrity](images/oom_crash_integrity.png)

**Availability Impact (A:H)** - High. Instance crashes completely, unavailable for all users.

From https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/gl-security/product-security/appsec/cvss-calculator/

`When evaluating Availability impacts for DoS that require sustained traffic, use the 1k Reference Architecture. The number of requests must be fewer than the "test request per seconds rates" and cause 10+ seconds of user-perceivable unavailability to rate the impact as A:H.`

This attack used < 1RPS which eventually caused an OOM crash on 1k Reference Architecture instance.
